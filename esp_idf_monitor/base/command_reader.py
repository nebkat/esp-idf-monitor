class CommandReader(StoppableThread):
    """Read line-based commands from a non-TTY stdin (pipe, file) and push the
    corresponding events to the event queue, until EOF or the 'exit' command.

    This is the non-interactive counterpart of ConsoleReader and allows the
    monitor to be driven by a script or another program::

        printf 'reset\\nsleep 10\\nexit\\n' | python -m esp_idf_monitor /dev/ttyUSB0

    EOF exits the monitor only if some input was read before it (the script
    has finished). When stdin is empty from the start (e.g. /dev/null), there
    is no script and the monitor keeps watching the serial output until it is
    stopped by a signal (Ctrl+C, SIGTERM).

    The 'expect' command blocks the script until a serial line matches the
    given regular expression, so 'expect PATTERN' as the last command exits
    the monitor when the pattern is seen (serial output is printed the whole
    time). An optional ``--timeout <seconds>`` flag bounds the wait: when the
    pattern does not appear in time, an error is reported and the script is
    aborted (the rest of it would run at a wrong moment), so the monitor stops
    instead of blocking forever::

        printf 'reset\\nexpect --timeout 10 ALL TESTS PASSED\\n' | python -m esp_idf_monitor /dev/ttyUSB0

    Note: 'expect' also matches output that was already received when the
    command is reached - a bounded look-back buffer of recent lines is scanned
    first, consuming up to the match - so a line printed just before the command
    is not missed.

    All events are pushed to the event queue (never to the command queue) so
    that commands are executed strictly in the order in which they were read.
    Empty lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored. Every processed
    command is echoed to stderr, so the progress of the script is visible
    even when stdout is redirected to a file.
